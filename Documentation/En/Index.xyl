  <p>The WebSocket protocol allows a <strong>bidirectional</strong> and
  <strong>full-duplex</strong> communication between a client and a server. The
  <code>Hoa\Websocket</code> library allows to create WebSocket
  <strong>servers</strong> and <strong>clients</strong>.</p>

  <h2 id="Introduction" for="main-toc">Introduction</h2>

  <p>The WebSocket protocol is standardized in the
  <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455">RFC6455</a>. It allows a client
  and a server to communicate between each other. This communication is
  <strong>bidirectional</strong>, it means that the client can send messages to
  the server, and <strong>vice versa</strong>. The server does not only send
  responses, it is able to send messages <strong>spontaneously</strong>. This
  changes the classical Web approach with its HTTP protocol. The WebSocket
  protocol is also <strong>full-duplex</strong>, it means that data are
  exchanged <strong>simultaneously</strong> in <strong>both</strong> directions:
  While a data is currently transiting from the server to the client, the latter
  is able to also send a message to the server. Consequently, the WebSocket
  protocol allows a high <strong>interactivity</strong> between both client and
  server. The client will often be a browser. It is important to notice that the
  URI schema (see the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986">RFC3986</a>)
  of the WebSocket is <code>ws://</code>.</p>
  <p>We can ask ourselves what are the differences between WebSocket and
  EventSource. Both solutions are fundamentaly differents: WebSocket allows a
  bidirectional and full-duplex communication, whereas EventSource is a
  technology based on the <strong>HTTP protocol</strong> and provides only a
  <strong>unidirectional</strong> communication. For this kind of usage, an
  EventSource server is more likely to be light, simple and it is designed to be
  robust regarding disconnections (see <a href="@hack:chapter=Eventsource">the
  <code>Hoa\Eventsource</code> library</a>).</p>
  <p>The WebSocket protocol starts by a handshake in order to start the
  communication and exchange messages formatted as frames.</p>

  <h3 id="Handshake_and_challenge" for="main-toc">Handshake and challenge</h3>

  <p>To <strong>start</strong> a communication with the WebSocket protocol, the
  client must send an HTTP request to the server asking to change the protocol.
  In this request, the client inserts a <strong>challenge</strong>, kind of
  enigma, that the server must solve. If it succeed, the communication will
  start.</p>
  <p>Starting by an HTTP request is not anodyne. It allows the WebSocket
  protocol to use the same network path as HTTP requests, and so, for example,
  traverse proxys, firewalls etc. This also eases the deployment of this
  protocol: No need to open a dedicated port, no need to have a specific
  configuration on the server etc. Finally, it allows to use a
  <strong>secured</strong> connection thought TLS. In this case, we will use the
  <code>wss://</code> URI schema.</p>

  <h3 id="Frame_and_opcode" for="main-toc">Frame and opcode</h3>

  <p>Messages between the client and the server are not exchanged verbatim.
  Actually, the message is <strong>formatted</strong> as a frame: A
  <strong>packet</strong> of bits with a specific design. In this case, we will
  find information about the type of the message, its length, some
  verification codes etc. We will find an explanatory schema in the
  <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-5.2">section 5.2, Base
  Framing Protocol</a> from the protocol specification for the most curious of
  you.</p>
  <p>The <strong>type</strong> of the message is called opcode. This is the most
  important information. We will find this term in the chapter many times. The
  <code>Hoa\Websocket\Connection</code> class provides constants to represent
  each opcode in order to simplify their use. This class ensures the protocol
  <strong>support</strong>.</p>

  <h3 id="History" for="main-toc">History</h3>

  <p>There is two versions of the WebSocket protocol in the nature: The standard
  version and the non-standard version. The standard version is the one
  described in the RFC6455. The last non-standard version has the following
  nickname: <em>draft-ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol-00</em> (or
  <em>draft-hixie-thewebsocketprotocol-76</em>), or
  <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/wg/hybi/draft-ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol/">Hybi00</a>
  for short. This non-standard version has many important security issues but it
  is in use in some languages such as Flash. Fortunately, this version
  disappears more and more and is replaced by the RFC6455.</p>
  <p>The <code>Hoa\Websocket</code> library supports both versions. It allows
  clients supporting different versions of the protocol to communicate between
  each other.</p>

  <h2 id="Write_a_server" for="main-toc">Write a server</h2>

  <p>The <code>Hoa\Websocket\Server</code> class allows to write a server
  <strong>manipulating</strong> the WebSocket protocol. This class inherits
  from <code>Hoa\Websocket\Connection</code>. The <strong>communication</strong>
  is based on a socket server. We will use the <code>Hoa\Socket\Server</code>
  class (from <a href="@hack:chapter=Socket">the <code>Hoa\Socket</code>
  library</a>) to fill this role.</p>
  <p>The WebSocket protocol runs on TCP, thus we will start a local WebSocket
  server on the 8889 port:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-php">$server = new Hoa\Websocket\Server(
    new Hoa\Socket\Server('tcp://127.0.0.1:8889')
);</code></pre>
  <p>Now, let's see how to <strong>interact</strong> with this server.</p>

  <h3 id="Listeners" for="main-toc">Listeners</h3>

  <p>The <code>Hoa\Websocket\Connection</code> class provides six listeners:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>open</code>, when a connection is <code>opened</code>,</li>
    <li><code>message</code>, when a <strong>message</strong> is received,</li>
    <li><code>binary-message</code>, when a <strong>binary</strong> message is
    received,</li>
    <li><code>ping</code>, when a <strong>ping</strong> is received,</li>
    <li><code>error</code>, when an <strong>error</strong> has been
    triggered,</li>
    <li><code>close</code>, when a connection is <strong>closing</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For the <code>message</code> and <code>binary-message</code> listeners,
  there is only one associated datum: <code>message</code>, which contains
  without any surprise the received <code>message</code>.</p>
  <p>For the <code>ping</code> listener, we will also find the
  <code>message</code> datum. Notice that the pong is
  <strong>automatically</strong> sent before the listener is fired.</p>
  <p>For the <code>error</code> listener, we will find the
  <code>exception</code> datum, which contains an <strong>exception</strong>
  (not necessary <code>Hoa\Websocket\Exception\Exception</code>, this can be for
  example <code>Hoa\Socket\Exception</code>). The listener is fired after that
  the connection has been closed.</p>
  <p>The <code>close</code> listener has two data: <code>code</code> for the
  <strong>code</strong> and <code>reason</code> explains the
  <strong>reason</strong> of this closing with a short message. We will find
  standard closing codes through the <code>CLOSE_<em>*</em></code> constants on
  the <code>Hoa\Websocket\Connection</code> class. For example,
  <code>Hoa\Websocket\Connection::CLOSE_NORMAL</code> represents a normal
  connection closing, without error, whereas
  <code>Hoa\Websocket\Connection::CLOSE_MESSAGE_ERROR</code> represents a
  connection closing because of a malformed message. This listener is fired
  after that the connection has been closed.</p>

  <h3 id="Send_messages" for="main-toc">Send messages</h3>

  <p>Let's complete our example to, in the <code>message</code> listener,
  <strong>send back</strong> to the client all received messages in order to
  create an <strong>echo</strong>. We will use the
  <code>Hoa\Websocket\Connection::send</code> method. Once our listener is
  registered, we can start the server thanks to the
  <code>Hoa\Websocket\Connection::run</code> method. Thus:</p>
  <pre data-line="5"><code class="language-php">$server->on('message', function (Hoa\Core\Event\Bucket $bucket) {
    $data = $bucket->getData();

    echo 'message: ', $data['message'], "\n";
    $bucket->getSource()->send($data['message']);

    return;
});

$server->run();</code></pre>
  <p>Now, let's test our server by creating a very simple HTML client:</p>
  <pre data-line="6,39"><code class="language-markup">&amp;lt;input type="text" id="input" placeholder="Message…" />
&amp;lt;hr />
&amp;lt;pre id="output">&amp;lt;/pre>

&amp;lt;script>
  var host   = 'ws://127.0.0.1:8889';
  var socket = null;
  var input  = document.getElementById('input');
  var output = document.getElementById('output');
  var print  = function (message) {
      var samp       = document.createElement('samp');
      samp.innerHTML = message + '\n';
      output.appendChild(samp);

      return;
  };

  input.addEventListener('keyup', function (evt) {
      if (13 === evt.keyCode) {
          var msg = input.value;

          if (!msg) {
              return;
          }

          try {
              socket.send(msg);
              input.value = '';
              input.focus();
          } catch (e) {
              console.log(e);
          }

          return;
      }
  });

  try {
      socket = new WebSocket(host);
      socket.onopen = function () {
          print('connection is opened');
          input.focus();

          return;
      };
      socket.onmessage = function (msg) {
          print(msg.data);

          return;
      };
      socket.onclose = function () {
          print('connection is closed');

          return;
      };
  } catch (e) {
      console.log(e);
  }
&amp;lt;/script></code></pre>
  <p>At line 6, we declare the address of the WebSocket server by using the
  <code>ws</code> protocol. At line 45, we use the
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/WebSockets/WebSockets_reference/WebSocket"><code>WebSocket</code>
  object</a> and we attach listeners, strongly similar to those of
  <code>Hoa\Websocket\Connection</code>!</p>
  <p>To test, we just have to start the server:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-shell">$ php Server.php</code></pre>
  <p>Then, open the client in your favorite browser. Each message sent to the
  server returns identically, we have an echo.</p>

  <h3 id="Broadcast_messages" for="main-toc">Broadcast messages</h3>

  <p>So far, the client speaks with the server and the server replies, but this
  is only a <strong>dialog</strong>. However, the server has all connections in
  memory. We are able to <strong>broadcast</strong> a message to all connected
  clients. So, we will use the <code>Hoa\Websocket\Connection::broadcast</code>
  method that will send a message to all other connected clients. Thus:</p>
  <pre data-line="5"><code class="language-php">$server->on('message', function (Hoa\Core\Event\Bucket $bucket) {
    $data = $bucket->getData();

    echo 'message: ', $data['message'], "\n";
    $bucket->getSource()->broadcast($data['message']);

    return;
});</code></pre>
  <p><em lang="fr">Et voilà !</em> Restart the server and open the client many
  times. Each message we send is broadcasted to <strong>all</strong> other
  clients! Our example is now an <strong>instant messaging</strong> tool.</p>
  <p>We have to understand that the <code>Hoa\Socket\Server</code> socket server
  works with <strong>nodes</strong>, it means an object that represents an
  opened connection. In this listener, to know the <strong>current</strong> node
  that has fired it, we have to call the
  <code>Hoa\Websocket\Connection::getConnection</code> method to get the socket
  server, and then, the <code>Hoa\Socket\Server::getCurrentNode</code> method.
  Similarly, we have the <code>Hoa\Socket\Server::getNodes</code> to get a list
  of all nodes. The <code>Hoa\Websocket\Connection::broadcast</code> method is
  in fact implemented in the <code>Hoa\Socket</code> library and hides this
  complexity. It is preferable to use this method for
  <strong>performance</strong> and compatibility reasons.</p>

  <h3 id="Closing" for="main-toc">Closing</h3>

  <p>To <strong>close</strong> a connection with a client, we use the
  <code>Hoa\Websocket\Connection::close</code> method. This latter is very
  similar to <code>Hoa\Websocket\Connection::send</code>. Its arguments are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>code</code>: The closing <strong>code</strong>, see the
    <code>Hoa\Websocket\Connection::CLOSE_<em>*</em></code> constants
    (<code>CLOSE_NORMAL</code> by default),</li>
    <li><code>reason</code>: A short message explaining the
    <strong>reason</strong> of the closing (<code>null</code> by default),</li>
    <li><code>node</code>: The <strong>node</strong> that will close the
    connection (<code>null</code>, by default, indicates the current node).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For example, when we will receive the message <code>I love you</code>, we
  will close the connection by explaining why, else we will only do an echo of
  the message:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-php">$server->on('message', function (Hoa\Core\Event\Bucket $bucket) {
    $data = $bucket->getData();

    if ('I love you' === $data['message']) {
        $bucket->getSource()->close(
            Hoa\Websocket\Connection::CLOSE_NORMAL,
            'Thank you but my heart is already taken, bye bye!'
        );

        return;
    }

    $bucket->getSource()->send($data['message']);

    return;
});</code></pre>
  <p>We can modify our client in order to show the code and the reason of the
  closing:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">      socket.onclose = function (e) {
          print(
              'connection is closed (' + e.code + ' ' +
              (e.reason || '—no reason—') + ')'
          );

          return;
      };</code></pre>
  <p>It is highly recommended to <strong>always</strong> use this method to
  close a connection instead of closing the TCP connection directly.</p>

  <h2 id="Message" for="main-toc">Message</h2>

  <p>There is two ways to send a message: Either in one piece if we have the
  message <strong>entirely</strong>, or in <strong>several</strong> pieces. Our
  message can also contain other things than text, for example
  <strong>binary</strong> data. In this case, we speak about a binary
  message.</p>

  <h3 id="Fragmentation" for="main-toc">Fragmentation</h3>

  <p>To send a message in one block, we use the
  <code>Hoa\Websocket\Connection::send</code> method as seen in previous
  sections:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-php">$server->on('message', function (Hoa\Core\Event\Bucket $bucket) {
    $bucket->getSource()->send('foobar');

    return;
});</code></pre>
  <p>In fact, this method has four arguments:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>message</code>: The <strong>message</strong>,</li>
    <li><code>node</code>: The <strong>node</strong> that will send the message
    (<code>null</code>, by default, indicates the current node),</li>
    <li><code>opcode</code>: The <strong>opcode</strong>, it means the type of
    the frame (<code>Hoa\Websocket\Connection::OPCODE_TEXT_FRAME</code> by
    default),</li>
    <li><code>fin</code>: Indicates whether the message is <strong>over</strong>
    or not (<code>true</code> by default).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We will use all these arguments by trying to send a
  <strong>fragmented</strong> message.</p>
  <p>In our example, we have sent a message entirely, in one piece, which is the
  most usual way to do. If we send a very long message, we will also use this
  method. However, it is possible that we have the message piece by piece, and
  then, we are unable to send it entirely. For example, if a message, with an
  <strong>undetermined</strong> length, is read on a stream, and we would
  like to send it to a client, we won't wait to get the full message: We will
  send each piece directly to the client. In this case, we speak about
  fragmented messages.</p>
  <p>We will use the next opcodes: <code>OPCODE_TEXT_FRAME</code> for the
  <strong>first</strong> fragment, and then
  <code>OPCODE_CONTINUATION_FRAME</code> for the <strong>next ones</strong>.
  Each time, we will specify that the message is not <strong>over</strong>
  thanks to the <code>fin</code> argument which will be set to
  <code>false</code>, except for the last fragment where <code>fin</code> will
  be <code>true</code>.</p>
  <p>The final user behind the client won't receive fragmented messages, but one
  message in one block once the last fragment will be received. From the server
  side, this will avoid to overload the memory with “transit” data, and also to
  overload the network with a heavy message. We send data as soon as we get
  them, and it is part to the client to <strong>reconstitute</strong> the
  message. The server acts in the same way when it receives a fragment message.
  Between both fragments, the server is able to compute other tasks. So, it is
  more interesting to use fragments instead of bufferizing the message.</p>
  <p>Let's see an example. We will send the <code>foobarbaz</code> fragmented
  message in three pieces. We can imagine we read these data on a socket for
  example, and that the data are coming as soon as they are available. Thus:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-php">$server->on('message', function (Hoa\Core\Event\Bucket $bucket) {
    $self = $bucket->getSource();

    $self->send(
        'foo',
        null,
        Hoa\Websocket\Connection::OPCODE_TEXT_FRAME,
        false // not the end…
    );
    echo 'sent foo', "\n";
    sleep(1);

    $self->send(
        'bar',
        null,
        Hoa\Websocket\Connection::OPCODE_CONTINUATION_FRAME,
        false // not the end…
    );
    echo 'sent bar', "\n";
    sleep(1);

    $self->send(
        'baz',
        null,
        Hoa\Websocket\Connection::OPCODE_CONTINUATION_FRAME,
        true // the end!
    );
    echo 'sent baz, over', "\n";

    return;
});</code></pre>
  <p>The <a href="http://php.net/sleep"><code>sleep</code></a> instructions
  allow to emulate a network latency or something equivalent. Each time the
  <code>send</code> method is called, data are <strong>effectively</strong> sent
  to the client, there is no buffer on the server side.</p>

  <h3 id="Encoding" for="main-toc">Encoding</h3>

  <p>All exchanged messages must be in the <strong>UTF-8</strong> format (see
  the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3629">RFC3629</a>). If a message
  from the client is not consistent with this format,
  <code>Hoa\Websocket\Connection</code> will close the connection appropriately
  with the <code>Hoa\Websocket\Connection::CLOSE_MESSAGE_ERROR</code> code, we
  have nothing special to do. Consequently, all the received messages in our
  listeners respect this encoding.</p>
  <p>However, <code>Hoa\Websocket\Connection</code> verifies that messages
  <strong>going to</strong> the client are consistent with this format. If the
  encoding is not appropriated, then a
  <code>Hoa\Websocket\Exception\InvalidMessage</code> exception will be thrown,
  which will close the connection and fire the <code>error</code> listener if it
  is not captured earlier.</p>

  <h3 id="Binary" for="main-toc">Binary</h3>

  <p>It is also possible to send <strong>binary</strong> data, more compacted
  than textual data. We speak about binary messages. We will still use the
  <code>Hoa\Websocket\Connection::send</code> method but with the
  <code>OPCODE_BINARY_FRAME</code> opcode. This makes sense only in the
  <code>binary-message</code> listener, it means in a “binary communication”
  between the client and the server. We can imagine the client sending
  coordinates and the server giving others (for example for a board game):</p>
  <pre><code class="language-php">$server->on('binary-message', function (Hoa\Core\Event\Bucket $bucket) {
    $data                          = $bucket->getData();
    $message                       = $data['message'];
    $point                         = [];
    list($point['x'], $point['y']) = array_values(unpack('nx/ny', $message));

    // compute a next point.

    $bucket->getSource()->send(
        pack('nn', $point['x'], $point['y']),
        null,
        Hoa\Websocket\Connection::OPCODE_BINARY_FRAME
    );

    return;
});</code></pre>
  <p>The <a href="http://php.net/pack"><code>pack</code></a> and
  <a href="http://php.net/unpack"><code>unpack</code></a> functions are
  precious friends here.</p>
  <p>Notice that binary messages can also be <strong>fragmented</strong>. We
  have to use the <code>OPCODE_BINARY_FRAME</code> opcode instead of
  <code>OPCODE_TEXT_FRAME</code> and then continue with
  <code>OPCODE_CONTINUATION_FRAME</code> as we have learned.</p>

  <h2 id="Write_a_client" for="main-toc">Write a client</h2>

  <p>The <code>Hoa\Websocket\Client</code> class allows to write a client
  <strong>manipulating</strong> the WebSocket protocol. This class inherits from
  <code>Hoa\Websocket\Connection</code>. The <strong>communication</strong> is
  based on a socket client. We will use the <code>Hoa\Socket\Client</code> class
  (from <a href="@hack:chapter=Socket">the <code>Hoa\Socket</code> library</a>)
  to fill this role.</p>
  <p>Much as <code>Hoa\Websocket\Server</code> is able to communicate with
  clients supporting different versions of the WebSocket protocol,
  <code>Hoa\Websocket\Client</code> uses <strong>only</strong> the RFC6455
  protocol. It means that the client is only able to communicate with a server
  supporting the RFC6455 protocol.</p>

  <h3 id="Start_a_connection_with_the_server" for="main-toc">Start a connection
  with the server</h3>

  <p>Like the server, the client inherits from
  <code>Hoa\Websocket\Connection</code>. We find the same <code>send</code>,
  <code>close</code>, <code>run</code> and other methods, and also the same
  listeners. And like the server, listeners must be registered on the
  client.</p>
  <p>Thus, to start a client, we will write:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-php">$client = new Hoa\Websocket\Client(
    new Hoa\Socket\Client('tcp://127.0.0.1:8889')
);
$client->on('message', function (Hoa\Core\Event\Bucket $bucket) {
    $data = $bucket->getData();
    echo 'received message: ', $data['message'], "\n";

    return;
});</code></pre>
  <p>The client can work in loop mode, like the server, with the
  <code>run</code> method. In this case, we will write:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-php">$client->run();</code></pre>
  <p>Or, for a sequential exchange, we have to manually call the
  <code>Hoa\Websocket\Client::connect</code> method:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-php">$client->connect();</code></pre>
  <p>If the server does not support the right protocol, a
  <code>Hoa\Websocket\Exception\BadProtocol</code> exception will be thrown.</p>

  <h3 id="Send_and_broadcast_messages" for="main-toc">Send and broadcast
  messages</h3>

  <p>To send a message, we will use the
  <code>Hoa\Websocket\Connection::send</code> method. Its behavior has been
  described previously for the server. It is identical.</p>
  <p><em>A contrario</em>, to receive a message, we will use the
  <code>Hoa\Websocket\Client::receive</code> method. The received messages from
  the server will fire listeners. Thus, we will send a message to the server,
  and then we will wait a response, twice:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-php">$client->send('foobar');
$client->receive();

$client->send('bazqux');
$client->receive();

$client->close();</code></pre>
  <p>The <code>Hoa\Websocket\Client::receive</code> method has no argument.</p>

  <h3 id="Note_about_the_handshake_and_the_host" for="main-toc">Note about the
  handshake and the host</h3>

  <p>In order the handshake to be complete, it is necessary to send a
  <code>Host</code> HTTP header, representing the name of the host. When the
  client is executed through an HTTP server, the host of the server will be used
  if available. Else, if it is not available, or if we execute the client in a
  command line for example, we have to specify a host with the
  <code>Hoa\Websocket\Client::setHost</code> method, before connecting the
  client (before the calls of <code>Hoa\Websocket\Connection::run</code> or
  <code>Hoa\Websocket\Client::connect</code>); thus:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-php">$client->setHost('hoa-project.net');
$client->connect();

// …</code></pre>
  <p>To know if the host is known, we can use the
  <code>Hoa\Websocket\Client::getHost</code> method. It will return
  <code>null</code> if the host is unknown. Or, during the handshake, an
  exception of type <code>Hoa\Websocket\Exception\Exception</code> will be
  thrown.</p>

  <h2 id="Customized_node" for="main-toc">Customized node</h2>

  <p>The <code>Hoa\Socket\Server</code> and <code>Hoa\Socket\Client</code>
  classes work with <strong>nodes</strong>: Objects representing an opened
  <strong>connection</strong>. The main class representing a node is
  <code>Hoa\Socket\Node</code>. The <code>Hoa\Websocket</code> library provides
  its own node: <code>Hoa\Websocket\Node</code>. We can <strong>extend</strong>
  this class in order to add and manipulate some <strong>information</strong>
  about a connection.</p>
  <p>For example, in the case of an instant messaging, we could store the
  pseudo of the client:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-php">class ChatNode extends Hoa\Websocket\Node
{
    protected $_pseudo = null;

    public function setPseudo ($pseudo)
    {
        $old           = $this->_pseudo;
        $this->_pseudo = $pseudo;

        return $old;
    }

    public function getPseudo()
    {
        return $this->_pseudo;
    }
}</code></pre>
  <p>The <code>Hoa\Socket\Server::setNodeName</code> or
  <code>Hoa\Socket\Client::setNodeName</code> methods allow to specify what
  node class the server or the client will <strong>use</strong>:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-php">$server = new Hoa\Websocket\Server(
    new Hoa\Socket\Server('tcp://127.0.0.1:8889')
);
$server->getConnection()->setNodeName('ChatNode');</code></pre>
  <p>Next, in our listeners for example, we will be able to use our
  <code>getPseudo</code> method:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-php">$server->on('message', function (Hoa\Core\Event\Bucket $bucket) {
    $node = $bucket->getSource()->getConnection()->getCurrentNode();

    var_dump($node->getPseudo());

    // …
});</code></pre>
  <p>If you set up a <strong>protocol</strong> by using WebSockets between
  your clients and your server, customized nodes will be very helpful to store
  extra recurrent information.</p>

  <h2 id="Conclusion" for="main-toc">Conclusion</h2>

  <p>The <code>Hoa\Websocket</code> library allows to create WebSocket
  <strong>servers</strong> and <strong>clients</strong> for more
  <strong>interactivity</strong> in your applications. The server is easily
  extensible thanks to the notion of <strong>node</strong> which eases the
  storage and manipulation of useful data to create its own protocol.</p>
